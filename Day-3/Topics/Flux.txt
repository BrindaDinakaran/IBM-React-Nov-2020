Redux

The reducer function receives Current state from store and action from UI
    if the action is performed,
        updated state is returned
        updated state is stored in store as Current state
        subscribe gives to UI
    else
        Current state is returned
        no update in store

Component should not know about actionCreators/Dispatch
Component should display data and call function when user interacts


1. Create Reducer with currentState as some default value and action
2. create store with reducer
3. create render function, inside that
    1. 
4. call once and subscribe
5. action creators


Reducer sync the data
Action creator does all data manipulation
