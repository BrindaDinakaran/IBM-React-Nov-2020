Steps to create closure:
1. An outer function
2. variable in outer function
3. An inner function (without nesting functions, closure is not possible)
4. variable in outer function is used in inner function
5. lifetime of inner = lifetime of outer. But we can increase the lifetime of inner function and variable

Closure: scope created by outer function, but controlled and managed by inner function.

Assignment 2:
create an object spinner with 2 methods: 
1. up() ==> increment by 1
2. down() ==> decrement by 1
NOTE: There should be no other way to change the counter or methods from console or window object
